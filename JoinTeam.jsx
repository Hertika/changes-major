            That's why we call our monthly donors "Team Tomorrow." Monthly donations help us consistently address the most urgent issues facing children today, so together, we can create a better tomorrow.

          Up to 15 million girls and boys will never return to school following the pandemic. More than 700 million children 
          are currently living in countries drastically affected by the climate crisis. Nearly 200 million children are living 
          in violent war zones. And in rural America, 1 in 5 children are experiencing food insecurity due to poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a monthly donor, you can make a massive impact for children in desperate need of help.
